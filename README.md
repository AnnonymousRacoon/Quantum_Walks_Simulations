# Quantum Walks & Matlab

1) [**coined quantum walk - complete graph + searching**](https://github.com/qwchagas/quantum_walk_matlab/tree/master/coined%20-%20complete%20graph%20%2B%20searching): we've implemented the coined quantum walk model, with three types of coins (grover, hadamard and fourier), over a complete graph and performing the searching problem with multiple marked vertices allowed;

2) [**staggered quantum walk - cycle**](https://github.com/qwchagas/quantum_walk_matlab/tree/master/staggered%20-%20cycle): we've implemented the staggered quantum walk model in the cycle graph and it's allowed to use non-localized initial conditions;

3) [**continuous-time quantum walk - cycle**](https://github.com/qwchagas/quantum_walk_matlab/tree/master/continuous%20-%20cycle%20): we've implemented the continuous-time quantum walk in a cycle and it's allowed the use of non-localized initial conditions;

4) [**continuous-time quantum walk - complete graph + searching**](https://github.com/qwchagas/quantum_walk_matlab/tree/master/continuous%20-%20complete%20graph%20%2B%20searching): we've implemented the continuous-time quantum walk model performing searching and with multiple marked elements allowed;

5) [**continuous-time quantum walk - square lattice**](https://github.com/qwchagas/quantum_walk_matlab/tree/master/continuous%20-%20square%20lattice): we've implemented the continuous-time quantum walk in a square lattice;
