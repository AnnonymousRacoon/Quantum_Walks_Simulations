# Quantum Walks & Matlab

1) [**coined - complete graph + searching**](https://github.com/qwchagas/quantum_walk_matlab/tree/master/coined%20-%20complete%20graph%20%2B%20searching): we've implemented the coined quantum walk model, with three types of coins (grover, hadamard and fourier), over a complete graph and performing the searching problem with multiple marked vertices allowed
