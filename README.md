# **Quantum Walks** 

## Implementations

1. MATLAB
- Coined Quantum Walk
  - [**complete graph + searching**](https://github.com/qwchagas/quantum_walk_matlab/tree/master/coined%20-%20complete%20graph%20%2B%20searching): we've implemented the coined quantum walk model, with three types of coins (grover, hadamard and fourier), over a complete graph and performing the searching problem with multiple marked vertices allowed;
  
  - [**complete bipartite graph + searching**](https://github.com/qwchagas/quantum_walks/tree/master/coined%20-%20complete%20bipartite%20flip-flop%20%2B%20searching): we've implemented the coined quantum walk model, with two types of coins (grover and hadamard), over a complete bipartite graph and performing the searching problem with multiple marked vertices allowed;

- Staggered Quantum Walk

  - [**cycle**](https://github.com/qwchagas/quantum_walk_matlab/tree/master/staggered%20-%20cycle): we've implemented the staggered quantum walk model in the cycle graph and it's allowed to use non-localized initial conditions;

- Continuous-Time Quantum Walk
  - [**cycle**](https://github.com/qwchagas/quantum_walk_matlab/tree/master/continuous%20-%20cycle%20): we've implemented the continuous-time quantum walk in a cycle and it's allowed the use of non-localized initial conditions;

  - [**complete graph + searching**](https://github.com/qwchagas/quantum_walk_matlab/tree/master/continuous%20-%20complete%20graph%20%2B%20searching): we've implemented the continuous-time quantum walk model performing searching and with multiple marked elements allowed;

  - [**square lattice**](https://github.com/qwchagas/quantum_walk_matlab/tree/master/continuous%20-%20square%20lattice): we've implemented the continuous-time quantum walk in a square lattice;

  - [**complete k-partite graph + searching**](https://github.com/qwchagas/quantum_walk_matlab/tree/master/continuous%20-%20complete%20k%20partite%20graph%20%2B%20searching): we've implemented the continuous-time quantum walk in a complete k-partite graph and performing the searching problem with a single marked vertex;
